# Phone Touchpad

Control computer mouse with an Android phone.

## Getting Started

A just-for-fun project!  
I have changed the code recently but I haven't tested it so I don't know if it really works or not. Give it a try. 游때  
Have fun with discovering the app! 游때  

### Prerequisites

   - An Android Phone  

   - Python  

### Installing

#### Computer

Download the repository:  

```
git clone https://github.com/datletrung/Phone-Touchpad  
cd Phone-Touchpad  
```

#### Phone

Install touchpad.apk  
You can modify my code using the following steps:  
  - Go to http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/  
  - Upload file touchpad.aia and start playing around! 游때  

### Running the code

There are 2 files which are run.py and test.py:
  - run.py runs a server and receives any phone that wants to connect to it.  
  - test.py is a testing version (I want to create a GUI that can inform us which Phone is being connected), play with it if you like.  

Start the server by clicking the file touchpad.py (do not open Python IDLE). You should see your computer's IP in the last line.  
Start the app on your phone, enter your computer's IP and tada!! 游때
